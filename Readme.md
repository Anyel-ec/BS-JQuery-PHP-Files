# Website with Bootstrap, PHP, jQuery, and File Handling

This is a website project developed using technologies such as Bootstrap, PHP, jQuery, and file handling. Below is an overview of the key features and important aspects of this project.

## Key Features

1. **Responsive Design**: The website is designed using Bootstrap to ensure it is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, enhancing the user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

2. **Dark Mode/Light Mode**: The website includes a toggle button that allows users to switch between dark and light modes of the design. This is achieved using jQuery to provide a customized visual experience.

3. **Page Translation**: Page translation functionality has been implemented. Be sure to include details on how to set up and customize this feature in the `index.php` file. You can use third-party translation services or JavaScript libraries to achieve this.

4. **Recaptcha in the Form**: The contact form on the website includes Recaptcha functionality to protect it from spam and abuse. You must configure Recaptcha with your own key. Refer to Google Recaptcha's documentation for instructions on obtaining a key and setting it up in your application.

5. **Email Sending with PHP**: The website uses PHP to handle email sending from the contact form. Ensure you configure the email sending function in the relevant PHP file. You can use PHP's `mail()` function for this task.
